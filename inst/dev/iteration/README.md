Intro to iteration (for loops and purrr)
=====

# Overview 

Iteration solves many common problems we encounter in data workflows. This tutorial covers the basics of iteration in R, starting with using `for` loops, their structure, designing your loops for optimal performance, and debugging errors. We also cover the tidyverse package for iteration, `purrr`, which uses functionals (a `tidyverse` equivalent to `for` loops).
